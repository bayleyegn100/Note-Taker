## Description 

I developed a Note Taker app. It can help any one to use this app take notes, edit, update and delete when necessary. It is designed to incorporate as much as the users demand. Once this app is developed they can generate their notes or todos easily. It is time saving, easy and can be refactored if necessary. The application designed for any one who want to use it. To develop this application, I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, a software registry and software package manager and installer called Node Package Manager (npm), express, file system, node.js and other relevant node.js framworks. 

## Motivation 

Now a days the way of informaion management is highly migrated from manual to digital form.

## Instructions

You do not have a limitation to use this application. As you see the license section at the top of this file it is open source to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this app for any purpose. If you interested you can use and start developing your notes and daily rutines. If you want to test the app first right click on the server.js file and click on ‘open on integrated terminal’ or you can use a terminal and drag or write the file inside opened terminal. If it is going well as attached in the screenshot foldor install the npm in the terminal. When the installation is completed type node server.js and hit the enter button. Following that the server start to listen on port. Now you can open a google chrome and run a http://localhost:4040. Here you will get a note taking appliction and you can write, save, edit, delete and update your notes. If you face any problem or would like to reach me, you can find my contact in the question section.
